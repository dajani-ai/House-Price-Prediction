# House Price Prediction Project

A Machine Learning project designed to predict real prices based on various features like area, location, number of rooms, and building age. This is my first project of my journey.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate house prices with high accuracy. This helps buyers and sellers understand the fair market value of a property based on historical data.

# Features & Workflow
- EDA: Visualized data to find hidden patterns and correlations.
- Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- Feature Engineering: Selected the most impactful variables for prediction.
- Preprocessing: Scaled and normalized data for model readiness.
- Modeling: Trained Linear Regression & Random Forest models.
- Evaluation: Achieved 82% Accuracy (R Squared Metric).

# Tech Stack
- Language: Python.
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn.
- Platform: Jupyter Notebook.

# Key Results
I discovered that the 'Median income for the area surrounding' and 'Living Area' were the top two factors influencing house prices in this dataset.
