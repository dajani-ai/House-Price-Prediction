# House Price Prediction Project
A Machine Learning project designed to predict real prices based on various features like area, location, number of rooms, and building age. This is my first project of my journey.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate house prices with high accuracy. This helps buyers and sellers understand the fair market value of a property based on historical data.

# Dataset Information
- Name: California Housing Prices.
- Source: kaggle.
- [Read the description](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices)

# Features & Workflow
- EDA: Visualized data to find hidden patterns and correlations.
- Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers, and other logical errors.
- Feature Engineering: Selected the most impactful variables for prediction.
- Preprocessing: Scaled and normalized data for model readiness.
- Modeling: Trained Linear Regression & Random Forest models.
- Evaluation: Achieved 82% Accuracy (R Squared Metric).

# Tech Stack
- Language: Python.
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn.
- Platform: Jupyter Notebook.
